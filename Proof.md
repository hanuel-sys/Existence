# Existence
Proof of God:

1) Change: If this moment (our talking) depended on an infinite number of previous moments and movements, then we'd never be having this conversation, because that would be the equivalent of saying that we can have this conversation after an infinite amount of time, and that would mean that this conversation would not even be initiated, because an infinite amount of time can't end, or even begin if you think about it. This is an infinite regress fallacy and is an impossibility. Therefore there needs to be a first movement which will initiate the change. And this first movement chose to move without being moved by any previous movement. Therefore it has a will, which is a key characteristic of God.

2) Matter: Matter gets its attributes and characteristics from something that is more "fundamental" than it, like subatomic particles -- quarks -- boson and so on. If this never stops, then nothing would exist. It would be like saying that a branch is held above the ground by an infinitely tall tree. The fact that anything exists and continues to exist is proof that there is something fundamental that is supporting all of these things and that it itself is not made of anything else and therefore is self-sustaining.

3) Finitude: If something has a shape, size, charge, or a specific characteristic, then what determined these limitations in the first place? If it were determined by another finite thing outside of itself, then this would go on forever, causing yet another infinite regress fallacy! Now if it were determined by the building blocks inside itself, then this would go on forever as well, causing another infinite regress fallacy. The only possibility left is that all forms and all limited characteristics of all finite things were ultimately created by something that has no finite limitations itself, i.e. something infinite. Therefore it is the ultimate/necessary thing that creates all other things.


4) Specificity: Things in the universe like the magnitude of gravity, electromagnetism, amount of energy in the universe,etc. are specific to a certain size, magnitude, quantity and quality. Considering that the universe could have one atom more than it has, the question is that what determined that it would be one way and not another? Let us consider that perhaps the conditions prior to this universe led to what we have right now. But then this again turns into an infinite regress fallacy. The only remaining explanation is that something determined by its will for all things to be the way they are.

These are logical certainties that prove that God is a " Necessary Existence".

Now that we have established that God exists, the question is.. Which God? Well, just keep on eliminating that which is contradictory in nature or has no evidence for it.
